# Object_Detection
Object Detection
This repository contains code and resources for object detection tasks using computer vision techniques. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

Features
Pretrained models: The repository provides pretrained models for object detection, which can be used directly for inference or fine-tuned for specific tasks.
Training scripts: Scripts are included for training custom object detection models using popular architectures such as YOLO.
Evaluation tools: The repository includes tools to evaluate the performance of trained models, calculate metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), and visualize detection results.
Data augmentation: Various data augmentation techniques are implemented to enhance the diversity and quality of training data.
Transfer learning: Pretrained models can be used as a starting point for transfer learning on custom datasets, reducing the training time and improving performance.
Inference scripts: Scripts are provided to perform object detection on images and videos using the trained models.
